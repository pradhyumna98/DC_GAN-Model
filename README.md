# DC_GAN-Model
It is a Deep Convolutional GAN Model which generates images of hand written digits, starting from taking noise as input.


### About DC-GAN
In this I have made use of learnable UpSampling layers from keras which in turn makes use Conv2DTranspose Layers.
From taking the noise as initial input from generating MNist Handwritten Images, image of the digits have been given after every 10 epochs.
We can increase the number of epochs to get better results.
